You Are Insufficiently Persuasive
---------------------------------

_Sandi Metz, February 7, 2018, 4:45pm EST_

### Introduction

This is not technical, but is about the problems in real programming and
software across the board.  The programming languages are the easy parts of
programming / development.

The community is good, but we're not entirely happy... and there's data on
that.

### Happiness

[Ref. study on Unhappiness of Software Developers]

Top 10 causes of programmer unhappiness:

1. Being stuck in problems solving
2. Time pressure    _external_
3. Bad code quality and coding practice _external_
4. Under-performing colleague _external_
5. Feel inadequate with work
6. Mundane / repetitive task
7. Unexplained or broken code _external_
8. Bad decision making _external_
9. Imposed limitation of development _external_
10. Personal issues, not work-related

All of the 'external' issues have to do with _other people_.  And the root
problem here is a problem of persuasion.

### Persuasion

Cialdini's 6 rules, built on research (from _Influence_)

1. Reciprocity - you're obligated to respond after I do a favor
    - Hare Krishnas giving flowers, taking money
2. Consistency - we strongly desire to appear faithful to what we've said
3. Social Proof - If I don't know how to behave, I'll look around at others
4. Authority - We defer to those who seem to know more / possess authority
5. Liking - If people like you, they are more likely to do as you ask
6. Scarcity - Fear of missing out adds value to surprising things, and persuades

He describes these as **weapons of influence**.  He is talking about using
these non-transparently to manipulate people.

### Another Perspective

Dale Carnegie / _How to Win Friends and Influence People_

1. Make People Like You
2. Handling People
3. Win People To Your Way of Thinking
4. Be a Leader

_Act as if others are interesting, and you will eventually find them so._

...But all of the advice here is predicated on us being right.

### How do you know you're right?

If you're wrong and get better at persuasion, it will make things worse. We
are often reduced to opinion and dispute about _means_ when we have the
same _ends_ that are possibly being ignored in the conversations.

### Motivation

Daniel Pink / _DriVE_ (also check out his TED talk)

What he discovered was that, where cognitive skills are concerned, bonuses
and rewards only motivate if someone is not being paid enough (for basics).

The big motivators for creative, cognitive tasks are

1. Autonomy
2. Mastery
3. Purpose

### Teamwork

Instead of asking 'How can we be more persuasive?', maybe we should ask 'How
can we build better teams?'

[Ref. Google's "Project Aristotle" study]

In Google's study, they couldn't find significant 'who' factors that had an
impact on team performance, etc.  But they did begin to look into _group
norms_ (which can override individual preferences).

### Emotional Intelligence of Groups

Do teams evolve IQs distinct from the individuals that make them up?

The primary factor turns out to be how the members of the team treat one
another.  (Parameters connected to 'Psychological safety')

This starts with you.

_You_ can set the tone for your next team meeting.

Fear may be the background noise of the human condition, but we don't have to
succumb to it.  **You are good enough.**  You aren't your past or your code.

To build the best team, you must be your best self.
